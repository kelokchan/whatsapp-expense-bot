# Deploy to Render - Quick Guide

## Why Render?

- ‚úÖ Free tier available
- ‚úÖ Auto-deploy from GitHub
- ‚úÖ Simple setup (5 minutes)
- ‚úÖ Docker support
- ‚úÖ Easy to view logs for QR code

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Free Tier Note

Render's free tier **spins down after 15 minutes of inactivity**. This means:
- Your bot will stop responding when inactive
- It takes ~30 seconds to spin back up when you message it
- **Not ideal for 24/7 usage**, but great for testing!

For 24/7 usage, consider:
- Upgrade to Render's paid plan ($7/month)
- Use Railway.app instead (has free credits)
- Or DigitalOcean App Platform ($5/month)

## üöÄ Deployment Steps

### 1. Push to GitHub (Already Done! ‚úÖ)

Your code is already on GitHub at:
https://github.com/kelokchan/whatsapp-expense-bot

### 2. Sign Up for Render

Go to: https://render.com

Click **"Get Started for Free"** and sign up with GitHub

### 3. Create New Web Service

1. Click **"New +"** (top right)
2. Select **"Web Service"**
3. Connect your GitHub account if prompted
4. Find and select: `kelokchan/whatsapp-expense-bot`

### 4. Configure Service

Render will auto-detect your Dockerfile. Configure:

**Name**: `whatsapp-expense-bot` (or any name you want)

**Environment**: Docker (should be auto-selected)

**Branch**: `main`

**Plan**: **Free**

Leave other settings as default.

### 5. Deploy!

Click **"Create Web Service"**

Render will:
1. Clone your repo
2. Build the Docker image
3. Start your bot
4. Show you the logs

### 6. Scan QR Code

**This is the important part!**

1. Once deployed, you'll see the **"Logs"** tab
2. Watch the logs - you'll see ASCII art QR code appear
3. **Quickly scan it with WhatsApp** before it scrolls away

**To see QR code again:**
- Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
- Or wait for it to restart
- QR appears in logs on startup

### 7. Scan with WhatsApp

On your phone:
1. Open WhatsApp
2. Go to **Settings ‚Üí Linked Devices**
3. Tap **"Link a Device"**
4. Scan the QR code from Render logs

### 8. Test Your Bot!

Send yourself a message:
```
/help
```

You should get a response! üéâ

## üìä Monitoring Your Bot

### View Logs

In Render dashboard:
- Click your service
- Go to **"Logs"** tab
- You'll see:
  - "‚úÖ WhatsApp Expense Bot is ready!"
  - Incoming messages
  - Any errors

### Check if Running

- Look for green "Live" badge
- Check logs for "ready" message

### Restart Service

If bot stops responding:
- Click **"Manual Deploy"**
- Select **"Clear build cache & deploy"**
- Re-scan QR code if needed

---

## üîÑ Auto-Deploy

Every time you push to GitHub, Render automatically:
1. Pulls latest code
2. Rebuilds Docker image
3. Restarts bot
4. **You'll need to re-scan QR code!**

To disable auto-deploy:
- Go to Settings ‚Üí Build & Deploy
- Turn off "Auto-Deploy"

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Free Tier Limitations

### What Happens When It Spins Down:

1. After 15 minutes of no activity, bot goes to sleep
2. Your WhatsApp session is saved
3. When you send a message:
   - Bot wakes up (~30 seconds)
   - Might miss your first message
   - Subsequent messages work fine

### Solutions:

**Option 1: Keep It Awake (Hack)**
- Set up a cron job to ping your bot every 10 minutes
- Use a service like cron-job.org or UptimeRobot
- Free tier allows this

**Option 2: Upgrade to Paid**
- $7/month for Render
- Bot runs 24/7 without interruption
- More reliable

**Option 3: Use Different Platform**
- Railway.app: Free credits (~500 hours/month)
- DigitalOcean: $5/month, very reliable

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### QR Code Not Showing in Logs

**Problem**: Logs don't show QR code

**Solution**:
- Trigger a new deploy: Manual Deploy ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
- QR appears during startup
- Have WhatsApp ready to scan immediately

### Bot Disconnects Often

**Problem**: Session keeps closing

**Solution**:
- This is due to free tier spin-down
- Upgrade to paid plan ($7/month)
- Or use Railway/DigitalOcean instead

### Build Fails

**Problem**: "Build failed" error

**Solution**:
- Check logs for error messages
- Common issue: Docker build timeout
- Try: Settings ‚Üí "Clear build cache & deploy"

### Can't Find QR Code

**Problem**: QR scrolled away in logs

**Solution**:
- Click "Manual Deploy" ‚Üí "Deploy latest commit"
- QR appears at startup
- Use Ctrl+F to search for "Scan this QR code"

### Bot Not Responding

**Problem**: Messages not getting replies

**Solutions**:
1. Check if service is "Live" (green badge)
2. Look at logs for errors
3. Service might be spinning up (wait 30 sec)
4. Re-scan QR code if session expired

## üí° Pro Tips

### Viewing QR Code Easily

After deployment:
1. Go to Logs tab
2. Use browser search (Ctrl+F / Cmd+F)
3. Search for: "Scan this QR"
4. QR code will be highlighted

### Keeping Bot Alive (Free Tier)

Set up a ping service:
1. Go to uptimerobot.com (free)
2. Add monitor for your Render URL
3. Ping every 5 minutes
4. Bot never spins down!

### Data Persistence

Your `expenses.json` persists on Render even after:
